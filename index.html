				<p class="content">Hello and welcome to The Misinformation Mallet! This is a webpage that is dedicated to keeping you aware of the dangers of misinformation on the internet. Misinformation has been plaguing the internet since the invention of online forums where people can share any information that they may find, and this webpage is here to tackle and debate this problem.  </p>	
				<p class="content">In this website, you can access the main content through the navigation bar above, and read the thoughts and ideas of yours truly. </p>
				<p class="content">This website was created as the project of a Computer Science 3 course by Josh Joner P. Calbang</p>

					<h3 class="content">2nd Quarter Changes!</h1>
					<p class="content">It's the 2nd quarter, and this website has some very exciting and <i>responsive</i> changes! Here are the changes in list form:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="content">This webpage is now, as you can see, on a domain! No more having to download a ZIP-file in order for you to view this webpage.</li>
						<li class="content">Another major change is that this webpage is now fully responsive! Meaning that devices of any shapes and sizes will be able to view the information in this website. (Although there are some limitations which are explained through the Questions (Webpage) section)</li>
						<li class="content">In compliance of it being responsive, some aspects have been changed. Like the navigation bar taking up only the left side instead of being full-width in order to make it responsive with any device (hopefully).
						<li class="content"><b>NO MORE ADS!</b> They are now replaced with "sponsors" that are located after this body and are unique per section.</li>

					<h2 class="content"> What can I expect from this website? </h2>
					<p class="content">The main features of this webpage are the 5 clickable buttons on the navigation bar that lead you to the homepage and the 4 other content pages of this website. Here are the descriptions of each of the clickable buttons of the website:</p>
					<ul class="content">
						<li class="content"><b>The Logo - </b>It leads you to this homepage, useless in here but very useful when you are on the content pages.</li>
						<li class="content"><b>Fun - </b>It leads you a webpage that contains a satirical essay about the misinformation spread on the internet.</li>
						<li class="content"><b>Information - </b>Currently it doesn't lead to anything, but it is supposed to lead you to a webpage that contains a serious article about misinformation, unlike the <b>Fun</b> button.</li>
						<li class="content"><b>Warning - </b>Currently it also doesn't lead to anything, but it is supposed to lead you to a webpage that lists dangers about misinformation spreading on the net.</li>
						<li class="content"><b>Call to Action - </b>Currently it also doesn't lead to anything, but it is supposed to lead you to a webpage that has ways for you to stop/prevent the spreading of misinformation on the internet.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="content">Why do you think that this webpage needs to be created?</h2>
						<p class="content">Misinformation has been around since probably when information was able to be communicated to other people (a long time). Spreading information for malicious intent or because someone did not know any better can harm everyone involved. This matter is even more highlighted now when the internet was created and even more when the World Wide Web allowed you to share your thoughts to the world.</p>
					<h2 class="content">Why is it named "The Misinformation Mallet"</h2>
						<p class="content"> Alliteration. The main goal of this website is to spread the prevention of misinformation on the internet, and a mallet is a type of hammer used to smash objects with heavy, blunt force. This website tries to encapsulate that feeling by being some sort of mallet that can smash the spread of misinformation on the internet</p>
					<h2 class="content">catJAM? Any reasons why the clip of a cat bobbing its head is prominent in the website?</h2>
						<p class="content"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Jc6CIfS1g41Cvldtu0xC2_A2OkFX0qa/view"> This webpage is not exactly a dedicated and serious one because of the fact that this is a project and a test to CSS and HTML skills. The catJAM clip serves as a wholesome placeholder for what would be actual links</a>

					<h1 class="text-center content">Questions (Webpage)</h1>
					<hr>
					
					<p style="height:50px; margin:0px"></p> <!--Empty Space Since Margining is too unnecessary-->
					
					<h2 class="content">What are those pictures at the left side? <strong>Outdated</strong></h2>
						<p class="content"><strike>Those are false advertisements in order to simulate what a real webpage would probably look like. It also gives me a reason to use my funny pictures and also for me to use the positioning style.</strike></p>
						<p class="content"><b>In this 2nd Quarter, instead of annoying, unresponsive adverts, we have now been sponsored and they can be found after this body paragraph where they will be indeed responsive.</b></p>
					<h2 class="content">Where are the pictures stored because this webpage only contains html and css files?</h2>
						<p class="content">The pictures and logos are stored in the Discord servers, which is a messaging application catered to fun purposes such as gaming. I don't know if it can hold pictures for long but it is a very easy alternative than just storing it locally.</p>
					<h2 class="content">How long did it take you to make this webpage?</h2>
						<p class="content">I don't keep track of time but if I had to estimate, I would say about 12 and above hours separated within different days and knowledge of CSS.</p>
					<h2 class="content">Font?</h2>
						<p class="content">The fonts shown and used here are <span style="font-family:'Krona One'">Krona One</span> and Commissioner. Both can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">here</a>.</p>
					<h2 class="content">Why is the main theme of this webpage purple?</h2>
						<p class="content">Two reasons: It's my favorite color, and it evokes a sense of calm while being mysterious, like the elements of the color blue and red at the same time.</p>
					<h2 class="content">Any reasons why the advertisements are gone and are replaced now with sponsors at the bottom?</h2>
						<p class="content">Limitations of my own knowledge on Bootstrap and CSS. I do not know how I can make something with an established position and scale it down in the same position in order to make it responsive, I feel like it is resource-intensive to try and spend time on what may be used for something else like other subjects.</p>
					<h2 class="content">So what are the limitations of this website's responsiveness as mentioned in the Changes section?</h2>
						<p class="content"> The limitations are: if you are on a device which supports cursor control and is of the medium size, the navigation bar at the top will expand down, causing an asymmetrical result. On tablets, laptops and phones, that "bug" is not present due to the three devices either being too large or are supporting touch-screen.</p>
