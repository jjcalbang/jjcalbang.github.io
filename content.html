			<h1 class="text-center">The Internet’s Interesting Ideas</h1>
			<hr>
			<p class="content">We all can agree that the internet is one of the greatest innovations of our time as humans. Started in the 1960s with ARPANET, this concept eventually grew to what we all know and love so dearly. Now why is the internet so wonderful? Well one big reason is that it connects a very large portion of humans together, and with this vast connectivity; information can travel at high rates through the cables and into our minds. With this power to share information given to the masses, there is bound to be new information that replaces what was once previously thought of. These interesting ideas should probably be explored more so that it may change the landscape of our knowledge forever.</p>
			<p class="content">Democracy is a system in which the masses choose what they want, and I believe that it can also be applied to the information shared on the internet. Through democracy of information, we are able to advance in our knowledge, such as what happened with Charles Darwin’s findings; he forwarded his research and thesis to the masses which advanced our understanding of the past. If information like that can shake the landscape of human knowledge during that time, then the internet nowadays can completely shake the world. The internet has cultivated a vast field of knowledge, and like democracy, we must use our voice to choose the right ideas of the world that we live in.</p>
			<p class="content">And one idea that some are “democratizing” is the idea that vaccines might be harmful instead of beneficial. The people who believe this idea think that they are being manipulated by people with more knowledge (doctors) for profit and harm. One of their proofs is from a discredited physician Andrew Wakefield, who linked vaccines to autism in only an astonishing 12 cases, which is a very amazing feat considering the very small evidences he had to prove it. They are dedicated to stopping the years of manipulation that was provided by those more credible than the masses. Their idea has the potential to change the world in a very drastic manner as it had already cemented itself into being one of the top ten health risks in 2019 by the WHO, which shows the power of their influence on the internet. We must be open-minded to their ideas, for all we know, maybe the generations of research and years of dedication by experts to clearly help prevent the spread of dangerous diseases that are rarely seen now because of vaccination might all be a ruse for just the simple concept of money.</p>
			<p class="content">On the topic of world changing ideas and generational manipulation, an idea that had been circulating since the 2nd century CE has the potential to do the same as vaccine hesitance; this is the flat-earth theory. This community believes that they have been lied and manipulated that a round Earth exists with simple but striking evidences like “The world feels flat, looks flat, so it is flat.” [⁶] Aside from their evidence stemming from their own senses, they also find new evidences that break the centuries of work that scientists have done in order to cater to their ideology. They are trying to break what was once “proven” by the efforts, research, and perseverance of Nicolaus Copernicus in an attempt to break the supposed layered lies that the government has posed in order to fool the masses. These two ideas that I have presented have been around before the internet was created, but was strengthened when it was finally introduced. But there are also new and revolutionary ideas that form and surface, so we also need to take a deeper look into them and consider them in our lives.  </p>
			<p class="content">One such idea that is very new, as of the writing of this essay (October 8, 2020), is the theory linking the Coronavirus to 5G. These people theorize and believe that the Coronavirus is just radiation stemming from 5G towers that had been set up in order to cover up their scheme. They believe that it is not just coincidence, poor preparation, and bad response that created the Coronavirus outbreak; they believe that it’s a side effect of 5G. Like vaccinations, these people believe that the Coronavirus is a cover-up for the exploitation of the masses by those more knowledgeable than them, and they are so sick of it that some are even destroying 5G towers to send a message. These people believe this because they do not know what’s happening, and as a result, they are paranoid and put the blame on others for something we all can’t control. This, and the two other ideas presented, demonstrates the power that these ideas hold when the masses are involved and democracy is invited.</p>
			<p class="content">With all these astounding and persuasive ideas, maybe it is too much to handle, and we should consider that some of them are not correct and are just building a bridge where we have already arrived at the correct conclusion. Maybe we have already explored the extent of our knowledge and some are just destroying the foundation of an already stable building. Instead of spreading new ideas with the intent of the complete reformation of histories of built up work, maybe we should research their cases and actually understand them; after all, generations of built up knowledge is more credible than a single one. The internet may have some interesting ideas, but interesting does not mean correct. We should try and research ourselves and understand the well-accepted ideas so that we are all in unity and can move forward in our society.</p>
